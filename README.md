### Snake Game

This program runs the Snake Game.

The player controls the Snake object with the Up/Down/Left/Right arrow keys.

The player's objective is to eat the Food items on the game board to increase their score,
without crashing the head of the snake into its own body or to the border walls.

The current high score is saved in "data.txt".
